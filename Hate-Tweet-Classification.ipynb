X (ex Twitter) has emerged as a strong channel of communication to gather and disseminate news, to forecast outcome of elections and to exchange political events and discussions. It has also become an  important analytical tool for crime forecasting, tracking terrorist activities and detecting hate speech.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hate speech is commonly defined as \"any message that mocks\n",
        "or discriminates against a person or group based on specific\n",

        "\n",
        "While NLP presents a promising approach to measure, detect and fight hate speech, that sounds more easy than it is. First of all, think about all the challenges that come with language evolution and language use in practice (e.g. sarcasm, slang, cultural variations) in understanding the true intent behind text. Moreover, there is an active discussion on what exactly consitutes hate speech from a legal perspective. Read more on this [here](https://aclanthology.org/2022.nllp-1.5.pdf).\n",

This might be a direct consequence of use of slang. Furthermore, words are not in their vector form. Which means 'hoe' and 'hoeing' would be treat differently. Also, with the use of Hashtags, the words are often compressed with no use of space. To improve the model, one can also take into account more words that would be indicative of hate-speech. This algorithm takes very limited words which popped up at the top of my head. \n",

It might make sense to take negations into account but it is difficult to work with in such a simplistic model. The ranking system would cancel the use of hate words if negation was found in a sentence. This technique would most importantly help us get rid of false positives/negatives. However, if implemented incorrectly, they could turn over the entire model. \n",

It is possible that the model is reliant on the few words that have been picked upon for hate speeech. A lot of words that were not used may have resulted in the inaccurate classifation. \n",
        "- **Bias Towards Predicting Hate Speech**: What is unexpected is how the model exhibits good recall but low precision for detecting hate speech. It successfully identifies most hate speech but also mislabels a lot of non-hate speech as hatee speech (low precision) - this can be a contextual issue that has been mentioned in Q8. Words surrounding the 'hate speech' need to be taken into consideration to be able to remove this bsia. This is particularly problematic as it could lead to over-censorship in real life situations.\n",
        "- **Poor Detection of Non-Hate Speech**: The very low recall for non-hate speech in the test dataset indicates that the model frequently misses identifying non-hate speech correctly, mistaking it for hate speech. slang is another factor that mucst be taken into consideration. The majority of users on twitter tend to be younger. So slang constantly eveolves and words may not represent their dictionary meanings. While this was not 'unexpected', this is something that was not taken into consideration initally.\n",
        "- **Optimize Training Approach**: Apply regularization techniques to reduce overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well across different datasets. Simplifying the model might also help in improving generalizability. We could do a cost analysis to determine the weights or impacts of false positives/negatics. With sentiments being taken into account, it is importantt to note that incorrect analysis could change tides and cause even riots.\n"

This showcases that TF-IDF helps the model identify critical words. Previously, all words were treated equally, but now standard words tend to be given less imporatnce. This would help reduce the impact of stop-words as they have not been pre-processed. Such words would not contribute to the analyis. Correspondingly, the accuracy rates have improved with the implemntetation of the TF-IDF where the uniqueness/impact of a word is weighed and valued. "

For example, social media platforms could use it in order to moderate relevant texts: this actually falls under the obligations of platforms to report on the moderating actions they have taken under the Data Services Act (DSA). You can check this database [here](https://transparency.dsa.ec.europa.eu/) and read more about the type of content being reported [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02894.pdf).\n",

        "1. There are definite coniderations that were taken for when and how I built the final model. The first and foremost is attempting to eliminate personal bias. The idea of immigration and misogyny evoke strong sentiments in me. This makes it important for me to not just classify any tweet/information that goes against my own beliefs as hate-speech. That would be a very elitist approach and I hope to have avoided doing so in the process. This is why it would be vastly beneficial for models to be developed in teams. Teams which are diverse and representtive of people from all backgrounds. This is something that we are failing to see with the rapid developments of AI. The most recent example being Gemini and its anti-white repersentation stance. This was problematic and such issues will continue to arrise if the developers go unchecked. \n",
        "As far as my own decisions are concerned, my idea of pre-processing may have caused issues. There were various aspects that my models had to overlook because of said pre-processing. This hindered the ability to make better judgement. I would hypothise that if my cleaning was not as 'intensive' my handcrafted features would have yielded better results.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. As mentioned earlier, the model is limited due to excess or incorrect pre-processing. This means that the data has been too normalised and important stylistic ffeatures have been overlooked or eliminated. This impacts the results. Experiments from Q16 showcase how the model was very limited. \n",
        "Another limitation of the model would be the lack of context consideration. A lot of words tend to be taken at face value. This might not work very well with a lot of tweets. This could be because of the use of slang where meanings of words get altered or just the use of negations or even punctuations. These were features that should not be overlooked. Sarcasm is also not detected with the lack of context. Sarcasm is also a difficult feautre to understand, where even people tend to not understand it at times (my roommate), so it is unfair to assume that machines can. \n",
        "We should also consider that all the language processing is done in English. There is a possibility that people may use words from other languages. This could be done with/without the Latin script that we are all accustomed to.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The potential stakeholders for such a system is difficult to determine. Firstly and most importantly, the model should be developed by speakers of the language that is being taken into consideration. The model should be consulted by linguists most importantly who understand the evolution of language and trends. In the absence of linguists, historians or journalists might be good alternatives. They are also quick to capture trends who can help us better. It is important to ask why a model is being built and who for. So, it is essential to understand from our clients what the real purpose of this is supposed to be, and then verify and validate if what was expected has been built.\n",
        "It would be smart to have a development team that is representative of the groups involved with such sentiments, if not the whole society as a whole. This would help us get a more nuanced and balanced understanding of how the sentiments can change and how tides shift.\n",
        "Lastly, if possible, analyising past data from where the data is being fetched -analaysing past tweets would be ideal for a twitter sentiment analysis.\n",

        "4. The government and marketting firms can benefit from such models. It helps them understand how the masses are behaving and what they wish to seek. These models could be further used to enhance recommender systems and advertisments accordingly. The government/political parties could also use this information to shift tides and influence how people feel. This could go so far to impact the results of elections. A very notable case being that of Cambridge Analytica and their influence on the elections. Such models could be used to directly attack democracy of a nation. They could be used to spark riots (Arab Spring). \n",
        "While there is a lot of harm that can be done, it can be used for good motives as well. For exmaple, a politican doing sentiment analyiss to make a policy change which reflects what the people want. The options are limitless. \n",
        "\n",
        "The people who are excluded from such are naturally the people who tend to not contribute to such datasets. This could be older people who are more resistant to accept new tech but this could also be people who are excluded from internet access. Where internet is cut off, the voice of people can be shunted. This could vastly impact how we view this world. This makes it incredibly imporatnt to evenly distribute how the data is collected and whom it represents. For example, western world has better access to the internet, which would represent them more than others. But this does not make them more important than others. Such models should not be used to polarise people on critical topics. \n",
